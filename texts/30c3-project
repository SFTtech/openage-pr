A free (as in freedom) clone of the Age of Empires II engine.


You know Age of Empires. You know its bugs. You know the fun playing it.

We are rewriting its engine in C++11 from scratch (GPLv3+). Including "modern" technologies like OpenGL and GLSL, we aim to create an exact clone (for now), using the original media files. This allows people using GNU/Linux to play the game natively, minus features, plus additional epic bugs (or was it vice versa?).
