### Where can I follow your progress?

You can follow our progress in many places, principally on our subreddit, on Github or our development blog, where regular development updates will be posted. We also have a Matrix chatroom where you can chat with the developers and ask us questions. ... TODO

### How much will openage cost?

### Is there any sort of competition with other projects of similar nature?

No, not at all. We support, and are on good terms with all community projects.

We are working together with other community projects and support them equally. ... TODO

... TODO

### How far along are you in the project in terms of percent?

Progress in any sort of development project, especially in game dev, is not linear. Usually, the first 30% to 50% of the project will take a long time due to designing and planning, then up to 90% will be faster with the basic groundwork in place, and finally, you reach that last 10% for polishing which could last as long as needed. Therefore, it’s not feasible to estimate progress exactly, but we can say that it’s coming along nicely so far. We hope to bring you a full-featured version of openage in the next couple years. .. TODO


### What's next?
Our focus is currently on building out the game engine's core system. Playable features will come once that's done. Your feedback and contributions are important to us and will help us to finish the project in less amount of time. Be also sure to check back for development updates and news about our progress!


## Regarding Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition

### Do I (eventually) have to buy DE2 to play AoE2 with openage?

No, you will always be able to use older versions like AoC or HD Edition as a conversion source. However, if you want to play with the new graphics or the 4 new civilizations, you must own DE2, so openage has something to convert the data from.

We will also try to make the versions interoperable to some degree. This would mean that someone who has converted from AoC would be able to play with someone converting from DE2 (although this would limit them to the AoC data set). Similarly, DE2 could be played with the old graphics style if you additionally convert media from HD or AoC.

### Is openage obsolete now that DE2 is out?

Certainly not. AoE2 is not the only game that runs on openage. openage supports all AoE-style games, which obviously includes AoE1, its Definitive Edition and SWGB, but can also be a platform for new unique games. And of course there is a lot of stuff that we still want to improve: Better modding support, scripting APIs, other running on operating systems, recreating the 3D asset sources... There's still much to do and we won't stop until we're there.

## Development

### Where can I report bugs?

Create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues). Your report should contain the following:

* short description of the bug (when, where, how it happened)
* general system info (operating system, openage version)
* optionally: screenshots for visual bugs, steps to reproduce the bug, error messages

The better you can describe the bug, the faster we can fix it.

### Where can I suggest features?

If you want to suggest *engine features*, the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues) is the right address.

For *minor gameplay features*, visit the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/openage/) and make a pitch. You can use the issue tracker for gameplay features too, but we obviously don't want a lot of issues that just say "Increase unit X's stats by 5". The developers visit the subreddit regularly and will discuss ideas together with the community.

## Legal

### What are the licensing terms for using the openage engine?

openage and its components are free software. Here is an overview of what licenses we use for parts of the project.

* openage: [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)
* openage-data: [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
* nyan: [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html)
* openage-modding: [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
* openage-masterserver: [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html)

### Can I use the openage engine to develop my own game?

Yes, you can develop any game with the openage engine and we encourage you to do so. You also don't have to ask for our permission. Just make sure that the source code is available when your game goes public.

### Can I sell a game developed with the openage engine?

Yes, that is possible. As the project is free software, there are no licensing fees involved. 

Be aware that you will be required to give your buyers access to the modified source code and modified versions of scripts, media files or documents that were taken *from our repositories*. Scripts, media files or documents that you wrote or created *yourself* can be licensed under the terms of your choosing. For example, nyan files, sounds, sprites, animations or a manual can use a proprietary license.

If you plan on selling physical copies of your game, make sure to include the GPLv3 license text on the physical medium.

### I want to use DRM to protect the game I made. Is that allowed?

In theory you could use DRM, but it would be pointless since you would need to publish the code for your copy protection too. People will just strip the DRM from your program. Save the time you need for implementing copy protection and instead make a game that everybody wants to buy.

## Misc

### How do I correctly spell the project name?

The official spelling is "openage" in all lowercase. We've seen many variations floating around (Openage, OpenAge, openAGE, Open Age, 0penage, etc.) and really don't mind how you spell it. However, the spellings "Open Age/OpenAge" are already taken by an organization in the UK that provides activities for elderly people. They shouldn't be used if you want to avoid confusion.
