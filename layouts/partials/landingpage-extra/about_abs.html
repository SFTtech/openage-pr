                    <p>While initially thought of as reimplementation of the Genie engine it is now far more than that.
                        It has a lot of improvements over the 20-year old components, adds completely new features on
                        top and provides better performance due to different design decisions being made and using
                        modern technology while implementing everything from scratch.</p>
